    "\n",
    "The most important part in this process is to decide on how to measure the results. Which key metric is best to track the two versions? What does it mean to sleep better? For me it would be a combination of things. The length of time asleep, level of discomfort during sleep and after waking, and level of restfullness I feel upon awakening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other variables that are important to consider are demographics of the sample I mentioned earlier, dosage level is it 5m or 10m, enviornmental effects on the subject; the room too cold or hot, is the bed uncomfortable, did the person eat well before bed, drink enough water? Are they healthy? "
