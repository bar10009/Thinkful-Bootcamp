What else can you tell me about the listing?
I can tell you that the most expensive listing is hoste by Marianne who's listing is located in the neighborhood of IJ - Zeeburgereiland and that it is a privated room avilable for a minimum of 3 three nights and the max isn't specified. This is the information that I deem immediately relevant to a prosective buyer but beyond that I can tell you the
longitude and latitude of the listing, name of the listing, host_id, id, calculated number of host listings.
